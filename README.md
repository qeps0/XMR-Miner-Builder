SilentXMRMiner v1.2.3 — Based on Lime Miner v0.3
.NET — Coded in Visual Basic .NET, requires .NET Framework 4.5.
Codedom — No need for external libraries to compile
Injection (Silent) — Hide payload behind another process
CPU & GPU Mining — Can mine on Both CPU and GPU (Nvidia & AMD)
Idle Mining — Can be configured to mine with a different Max CPU when computer is idle
Stealth — Pauses the miner while Task Manager, Process Hacker or Process Explorer is open
Watchdog — Replaces the miner if removed and starts it if closed down
